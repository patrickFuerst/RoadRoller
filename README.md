RoadRoller
==========

Road Roller is a mobile game created as part of the Multimedia class at Vienna University of Technology.

The project’s objective was to implement a game with JavaME from scratch.

STORY:
======

After a night of heavy partying you find a parked road roller whith the key stuck in the ignition and you decide to ride home on it. Suddenly you realise that the breaks don’t work and you have no chance of bringing the road roller to a halt. Now it’s rolling. The more obstacles you overrun the more points you get. You will also need to fill up the tank before it’s empty.

You can download the game from my site <a href="http://www.patrickfuerst.at/portfolio/road-roller/">here</a> as a Java archive. To run it on the computer make sure to install the JavaMe SDK and follow these steps.

Open Terminal and go to the folder where the Java archive is saved and type the following:

“pathToJavaSDK”/resources/bin/emulator -Xdescriptor:RoadRoller.jad
